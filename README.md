# PetPal - Dragonhack2021 project submission - team Mravljice

## Description
Our project called PetPal is intended for all dog owners (with the option of expanding to people with other pets in the future as well). Have you ever wished for a mobile app that would spare you the trip or call to the veterinarian every time something is wrong with your loyal best friend? Or are you simply scared every time you notice a scratch or a bump somewhere on your favourite little devil? Worry no more, with the use of our app - PetPal - you can list the symptoms to our trained chatbot, which obtains data from reliable online sources. If there is something you need to worry about, the bot will tell you so and send you to go see the vet when necessary. PetPal also offers a platform where you can see info specifically about your dog breed, and check how your furry buddy stands out in terms of size and weight compared to others of the same species. You can add multiple dog profiles to your PetPal app, and see characteristics and specifics of your pet dog. Keep up with notifications and reminders you set, like important dates of dog's vaccinations. It can also be interesting to read a fresh fun dog fact every once in a while. Let's enjoy being pet owners, and let's let them enjoy being our pets!
